# AWS Infrastructure & Architecture Portfolio

This portfolio documents my hands-on, build-as-I-learn journey while preparing
for the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03), with a strong focus on
secure infrastructure design, least-privilege access, and architectural
decision-making.

## Focus Areas
- AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Secure EC2 baseline architectures
- Storage design and trade-offs (EBS, EFS, Instance Store)
- CLI-driven workflows and automation mindset

## Projects
#### aws-iam-basics-lab/
- **aws-iam-foundations** — Identity design using users, groups, roles, policies, MFA, and IAM security tools
- **aws-ec2-baseline-architecture** — Secure EC2 deployment with IAM roles, security groups, SSH access models, and cost-aware instance selection
- **aws-ec2-storage-decisions** — Architect-level storage decision-making and recovery patterns
#### aws-vpc-foundations/

All builds emphasize *design intent*, *security rationale*, and *operational clarity*.
